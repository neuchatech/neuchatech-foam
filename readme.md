# Neuchatech Foam ‚Äì Custom Graph Explorer for Markdown Wikis

This project is a fork of the Foam VSCode extension to implement a smarter and more structured knowledge graph. The key goals are to enhance the visualization and semantic structure of personal wikis by integrating **file hierarchy**, **custom node behavior**, and **improved UX** into the Foam graph panel.

This document provides a high-level roadmap for the project.

## üß≠ Goals

1. **Dual Relationship Model**
   - Show both:
     - Reference links (`[[wikilinks]]`, `#tags`, etc.)
     - Structural links (folder hierarchy, special parent-child relationships)

2. **Smarter Node Behavior**
   - Use `README.md` or designated index files as the main node for a folder.
   - Display clean and zoom-adaptive node titles (e.g. show only top-level folders when zoomed out).

3. **Better UX and Control**
   - Highlight differences between structural and reference links visually.
   - Let user toggle visibility and weight of structural/reference links.
   - Provide an elegant, tree-first graph layout, with wikilinks bringing context-aware "cross-branches".

## üî± Overview of Strategy

- **Start from the official Foam repo**:
  - GitHub: [https://github.com/foambubble/foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam)
  - Extension ID: `foam.foam-vscode`
  - The graph view lives in the WebView under `static/dataviz`, with supporting logic in `src/core/`.

- **Create a fork** of the repo:
  - Name: `neuchatech/foam`
  - Maintain easy upgradeability from upstream
  - Isolate our custom logic in a `neuchatech` namespace or a feature flag if needed

## üöÄ Getting Started with Neuchatech Foam

This section explains how to compile, install, and run this custom version of Foam.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version specified in `engines.node` in [`package.json`](projets/neuchatech-foam/package.json:27), currently `>=18`)
*   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Compilation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    If you haven't already, clone the `neuchatech-foam` repository (or your fork of it):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/neuchatech/foam.git # Or your fork's URL
    cd neuchatech-foam
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    From the root of the `neuchatech-foam` directory:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Build the extension:**
    This command compiles all packages in the monorepo.
    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```

4.  **Package the VSCode extension:**
    This creates a `.vsix` file for the `foam-vscode` package.
    ```bash
    yarn package-extension
    ```
    The packaged extension (e.g., `foam-vscode-0.26.11.vsix`) will be located in the `projets/neuchatech-foam/packages/foam-vscode/` directory. The version number in the filename (currently `0.26.11` as per [`packages/foam-vscode/package.json`](projets/neuchatech-foam/packages/foam-vscode/package.json:11)) might differ based on the current package version.

### Installation in VSCode

1.  **Uninstall or Disable Official Foam Extension:**
    This fork currently uses the same extension ID (`foam.foam-vscode`) as the official Foam extension (defined in [`packages/foam-vscode/package.json`](projets/neuchatech-foam/packages/foam-vscode/package.json:2-13)). To avoid conflicts, you **must uninstall or disable the official Foam extension** from your VSCode instance before installing this fork.

2.  **Install from VSIX:**
    *   Open VSCode.
    *   Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X).
    *   Click on the "..." (More Actions) menu in the top-right corner of the Extensions view.
    *   Select "Install from VSIX..."
    *   Navigate to and select the `.vsix` file you created in the compilation step (e.g., `projets/neuchatech-foam/packages/foam-vscode/foam-vscode-0.26.11.vsix`).
    *   VSCode will install the extension. You may need to reload VSCode.

### Usage

Once installed, Neuchatech Foam will replace the standard Foam extension. You can use its features as you normally would with Foam, now including the enhanced graph visualization and other custom features detailed in this README.

**Important Note on Extension ID:**
As mentioned, this fork uses the ID `foam.foam-vscode`. If you plan to use this fork alongside the official Foam extension or distribute it more widely, it is highly recommended to change the `publisher` and/or `name` fields in the [`packages/foam-vscode/package.json`](projets/neuchatech-foam/packages/foam-vscode/package.json:2-13) file to create a unique extension ID (e.g., `neuchatech.foam-custom`). This would allow both extensions to be installed simultaneously, though you would still need to manage which one is active for your workspace to avoid potential feature overlap or conflicts.

## üß© Components to Build

### 1. **Graph Model Changes**

#### ‚û§ Add Structural Links
- For each note, create an edge from its parent folder (or index file) to itself.
- Create folder nodes (`id: "folder:/path/to/folder"`) for structure.
- Use `README.md` or special files (e.g. `index.md`, `folder.md`) as the visual anchor node of a folder.

#### ‚û§ Edge Typing
- Add `type: 'reference' | 'structural' | 'tag'` to each edge.
- Render edges with type-aware styles and behaviors.

#### ‚û§ Folder Nodes
- Option 1: Add actual folder nodes.
- Option 2 (preferred): Use a note within the folder (e.g. `README.md`) as the node for the folder, and attach all structural links to that.

### 2. **Graph Rendering Enhancements**

#### ‚û§ Visual Differentiation
- Structural links: thicker, more stable spring force, gray color.
- Reference links: thinner, more flexible, blue or colored.

#### ‚û§ Adaptive Node Titles
- Show only top-level folders and key nodes at low zoom.
- Gradually reveal child nodes' labels as you zoom in.

#### ‚û§ Layout Bias
- Use force-directed simulation with stronger spring constants for structural edges.
- Ensure a quasi-tree layout that becomes radial at scale, but keeps structure readable.

#### ‚û§ Filtering Controls
- Toggle buttons for:
  - `‚òë Show Structural Links`
  - `‚òë Show Reference Links`
- Optional: show/hide tag nodes separately.

## üõ† Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fork and Setup

- [ ] Fork Foam repository to `neuchatech/foam`
- [ ] Set up dev environment and local build process
- [ ] Rebrand extension (if needed) with namespace (e.g. `neuchatech.foam-viz`)

### Phase 2: Add Structural Logic

- [ ] Modify `generateGraphData` to:
  - [ ] Include parent folder links
  - [ ] Create synthetic folder nodes (if no README found)
  - [ ] Recognize `README.md` or `index.md` as a folder root node

- [ ] Tag all edges with `type: 'structural'` or `'reference'`

### Phase 3: Graph UI Changes

- [ ] Update `graph.js` to:
  - [ ] Style structural edges differently
  - [ ] Add toggles to control edge types
  - [ ] Filter edges at draw time based on toggle states

- [ ] Update layout algorithm:
  - [ ] Assign higher strength to structural links
  - [ ] Tune repulsion/spring constants for clarity

### Phase 4: Node Behavior and Labeling

- [ ] Display simplified node labels at low zoom (e.g. only top folders)
- [ ] Add hover tooltips or node popups for additional info
- [ ] Use `README.md` or designated file as title node for folders

### Phase 5: Configuration and Extensibility

- [ ] Add settings to `foam.graph.style`:
  - `structuralLineColor`
  - `structuralLineWidth`
  - `labelVisibilityZoomThresholds`

- [ ] Optional: Add metadata overrides via frontmatter (e.g. `parent:` or `displayInGraph: false`)

---

## ‚ú® Future Ideas

- Custom edge types (e.g. manual `parent:` relationships in frontmatter)
- Add a "breadcrumb" overlay on graph traversal
- Export graph snapshots as SVG or image
- Integration with GitHub README rendering
- Use mermaid graphs or YAML metadata for predefined structures

## üìÅ Folder Structure Example

```

wiki/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ repice/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md        ‚Üê becomes node for "repice/"
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pasta.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cake.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ research/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md        ‚Üê node for "research/"
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ foam-study.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ graph-algos.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md             ‚Üê global root node

```

Graph edges:
- `index.md ‚Üí repice/README.md` (structural)
- `repice/README.md ‚Üí pasta.md` (structural)
- `pasta.md ‚Üí cake.md` (reference: if linked via `[[cake]]`)
