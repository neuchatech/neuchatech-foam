# Project Kickoff: Neuchatech Foam - 2025-05-18

## Participants
- Strategic Planner
- Technical Lead
- Developer

## Project Overview
This project involves forking the Foam VSCode extension to create "neuchatech-foam". The primary goal is to enhance the knowledge graph visualization by integrating file hierarchy, custom node behavior, and improved UX.

Key documents (original location):
- `projets/neuchatech-foam_old/README.md`
- `projets/neuchatech-foam_old/DR-implementation.md`
(These have been moved into the `projets/neuchatech-foam` directory, which is now the root of the forked codebase).

## Initial Discussion

[StrategicPlanner] @All: Welcome to the neuchatech-foam project kickoff. The user has provided detailed research and a clear vision in `projets/neuchatech-foam_old/README.md` and `DR-implementation.md`. Our main objective is to create a more structured and semantically rich graph visualization for Markdown wikis. The user also mentioned making this a submodule and pushing it to GitHub as `neuchatech-foam`. We should keep this in mind for version control.

[TechnicalLead] @StrategicPlanner, @Developer: Understood. The provided documents outline a phased approach, starting with forking the official Foam repo. Key technical challenges will involve modifying `graph.ts` for data generation and the D3.js logic in `graph.html` for rendering. The introduction of 'structural' vs. 'reference' links is a core concept.

[Developer] @TechnicalLead: The implementation notes in `projets/neuchatech-foam_old/DR-implementation.md` (now in `projets/neuchatech-foam/DR-implementation.md`) provide good starting points for code modifications, especially for detecting folder root nodes and styling edges. The testing section also gives clear validation criteria.

[StrategicPlanner] @All: Excellent. Let's define initial success criteria:
1. Successfully fork the Foam repository.
2. Set up the local development environment for the forked extension.
3. Implement the basic structural link generation (Phase 2 from `projets/neuchatech-foam/README.md`).
   - This includes recognizing `README.md` or `index.md` as folder root nodes.
   - Edges are tagged with `type: 'structural'` or `'reference'`.

The user will handle git commands manually, so we will provide them as code blocks.

## Phase 1: Fork and Setup - 2025-05-18

[StrategicPlanner] @User, @All: We are now starting Phase 1: "Fork and Setup".
The first step is for the user to fork the `foambubble/foam` repository on GitHub to their `neuchatech` account (e.g., as `neuchatech/foam`).
Once that's done, we need to decide on the local path for adding this fork as a submodule. The current planning documents are in `projets/neuchatech-foam_old`.

[TechnicalLead] @StrategicPlanner: To keep the planning documents separate from the codebase, I suggest adding the submodule to a new directory like `projets/neuchatech-foam-src`. If the user prefers `projets/neuchatech-foam` for the code, the existing planning files would need to be moved (e.g., to `projets/neuchatech-foam-docs`).

[StrategicPlanner] @User: Please advise on the preferred local path for the submodule. I will then provide the `git submodule add` command.

[User Response via Agent] User has forked to `neuchatech/neuchatech-foam`. The existing `projets/neuchatech-foam` has been renamed to `projets/neuchatech-foam_old`. User wants to clone the fork into `projets/neuchatech-foam` and then move the planning documents from `projets/neuchatech-foam_old` into the new `projets/neuchatech-foam`.

[TechnicalLead] @StrategicPlanner, @Developer: This approach works. The `projets/neuchatech-foam` directory will now be the root of the forked codebase, containing the planning documents as well. This means the main WIKI project will eventually treat `projets/neuchatech-foam` as a submodule.

[Developer] @All: Commands provided to the user for cloning and moving files:
```powershell
# 1. Clone your forked repository
git clone https://github.com/neuchatech/neuchatech-foam.git projets/neuchatech-foam

# 2. Move your planning documents into the new submodule directory
Move-Item -Path "projets/neuchatech-foam_old/README.md" -Destination "projets/neuchatech-foam/README.md"
Move-Item -Path "projets/neuchatech-foam_old/DR-implementation.md" -Destination "projets/neuchatech-foam/DR-implementation.md"
```
User confirmed successful execution of these commands. The fork is in `projets/neuchatech-foam`.

[StrategicPlanner] @User, @All: The next step is to formally add `projets/neuchatech-foam` as a submodule to the main WIKI project.

[Developer] @User: Commands to add `projets/neuchatech-foam` as a submodule:
```powershell
# Run from the WIKI project root (c:\Users\oncho\Documents\WIKI)
git submodule add --name neuchatech-foam ./projets/neuchatech-foam projets/neuchatech-foam
git add .gitmodules projets/neuchatech-foam
git commit -m "Add neuchatech-foam project as a submodule"
```
After this, the user should set up the development environment within `projets/neuchatech-foam` (e.g., `npm install`).
