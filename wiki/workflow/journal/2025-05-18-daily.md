# Daily Journal - 2025-05-18

**Session:** daily

## 1. Session Goals
*   [X] Complete agent initialization routine (Steps 1-3).
*   [X] Begin work on "neuchatech-foam" project: Phase 1 - Fork and Setup.
    *   [X] Provide commands to clone user's fork (`neuchatech/neuchatech-foam`) and organize planning documents.
    *   [X] Provide command to add the fork as a submodule to the main WIKI project. (Commands provided, pending user execution and clarification on structure).
    *   [ ] Discuss local development environment setup for the forked repository (`projets/neuchatech-foam`).
*   [ ] Document initial project understanding for neuchatech-foam (partially done by referencing planning docs).

---

## 2. Project Understanding & Context
*   Current project: "neuchatech-foam". This involves forking the Foam VSCode extension to enhance graph visualization.
*   The user has provided detailed research in `projets/neuchatech-foam_old/README.md` and `projets/neuchatech-foam_old/DR-implementation.md` (these have been moved to `projets/neuchatech-foam/`).
*   The main goals are to integrate file hierarchy, custom node behavior, and improved UX into the Foam graph.
*   The user intends to manage this as a submodule and push it to their GitHub. Git commands will be provided as code blocks for manual execution by the user.
*   **Agent workflow files (journal, conversations) have been moved by the user to `projets/neuchatech-foam/wiki/workflow/`.**
*   Relevant decisions from recent project chat threads:
    *   Project kickoff and initial success criteria defined.
    *   User confirmed fork to `neuchatech/neuchatech-foam`.
    *   Plan to clone fork to `projets/neuchatech-foam` and move planning docs into it.
    *   `projets/neuchatech-foam` will be added as a submodule to the main WIKI project.
*   Link to relevant thread(s): [2025-05-18-init.md](../conversations/2025-05-18-init.md) (Path relative to new journal location)

## 3. Progress & Activities
*   **09:48 AM** - Started agent initialization routine.
*   **09:48 AM** - Executed `Get-Date`, `ls`, `tree /f /a src`, `tree /f /a wiki`. `src` directory not found at root.
*   **09:49 AM** - Assessed project chat: No existing threads found in `wiki/workflow/conversations` (original root location).
*   **09:49 AM** - Created initial project chat thread: `wiki/workflow/conversations/2025-05-18-init.md` (original root location).
*   **09:49 AM** - Assessed journal: No existing journal files found in `wiki/workflow/journal/` (original root location).
*   **09:49 AM** - Attempted to read journal template at `wiki/workflow/templates/journal-template.md` (failed, file not found).
*   **09:49 AM** - Successfully read journal template from `projets/neuchatech-tf/wiki/workflow/templates/journal-template.md`.
*   **09:49 AM** - Created new daily journal: `wiki/workflow/journal/2025-05-18-daily.md` (original root location).
*   **09:50 AM** - Updated project chat with start of Phase 1 for neuchatech-foam. Asked user for preferred submodule path.
*   **10:10 AM** - User confirmed fork `neuchatech/neuchatech-foam` created. User renamed `projets/neuchatech-foam` to `projets/neuchatech-foam_old`.
*   **10:10 AM** - Provided PowerShell commands to clone `neuchatech/neuchatech-foam` into `projets/neuchatech-foam` and move `README.md` and `DR-implementation.md` from `projets/neuchatech-foam_old` into the new `projets/neuchatech-foam`.
*   **10:10 AM** - Updated project chat (at original location) with these developments.
*   **10:19 AM** - User confirmed successful clone and file move. Inquired about making it a submodule.
*   **10:20 AM** - Provided PowerShell commands to add `projets/neuchatech-foam` as a submodule to the main WIKI project.
*   **10:20 AM** - Updated project chat (at original location) with submodule commands.
*   **10:34 AM** - User message indicates `wiki/workflow` (containing agent's journal & conversation files) has been moved into `projets/neuchatech-foam/wiki/workflow/`. This journal entry is now being written to that new location.

## 4. Blockers & Challenges
*   Initial attempt to read journal template failed due to incorrect path. Resolved by finding template at an alternative path.
*   **New:** Agent workflow files (journal, conversations) are now inside the `projets/neuchatech-foam` directory. This might complicate the submodule strategy if these files are not intended to be part of the `neuchatech-foam` repository's history.

---

## 5. Learnings & Observations
*   The specified path for the journal template in the custom instructions (`/wiki/workflow/templates/journal-template.md`) might need updating if `projets/neuchatech-tf/wiki/workflow/templates/journal-template.md` is the correct canonical location.
*   Clarified submodule strategy: the forked repo itself will be cloned directly, and then later added as a submodule to the main WIKI project.
*   **New:** The location of agent workflow files needs to be considered carefully with respect to the submodule structure.

---

## 6. Next Steps
*   Clarify with the user if the agent's workflow files (journal, conversations) should remain inside `projets/neuchatech-foam/wiki/workflow/` or be moved back to the main WIKI project's `wiki/workflow/` directory, especially before formally making `projets/neuchatech-foam` a submodule.
*   Discuss setting up the local development environment for the `neuchatech-foam` VSCode extension (i.e., inside the `projets/neuchatech-foam` directory).
*   Revisit `git submodule add` commands based on the decision about workflow file location.
