## 2. Project Understanding & Context
*   Current project: "neuchatech-foam". Forked Foam VSCode extension for enhanced graph visualization.
*   Repository is cloned into `projets/neuchatech-foam` and added as a submodule to the main WIKI project.
*   Agent workflow files (journal, conversations) are located within the submodule at `projets/neuchatech-foam/wiki/workflow/`.
*   Phase 1 (Fork and Setup) is complete, including cloning the repository and organizing initial planning documents.
*   Moving into Phase 2: Add Structural Logic and Phase 4: Node Behavior and Labeling.
*   Relevant documents:
    *   [`projets/neuchatech-foam/README.md`](../../../README.md)
    *   [`projets/neuchatech-foam/DR-implementation.md`](../../DR-implementation.md)
*   Link to previous conversation thread: [2025-05-18-init.md](../conversations/2025-05-18-init.md)
*   Link to new conversation thread for Phase 2: [2025-05-18-phase2-implementation.md](../conversations/2025-05-18-phase2-implementation.md)

## 3. Progress & Activities
*   **10:37 AM** - User confirmed successful cloning and submodule setup, including moving agent workflow files into the submodule directory. User requested starting implementation phase and creating new journal/conversation entries.
*   **10:38 AM** - Read journal template from `projets/neuchatech-tf/wiki/workflow/templates/journal-template.md`.
*   **10:38 AM** - Created new journal entry for the second session of the day: [`projets/neuchatech-foam/wiki/workflow/journal/2025-05-18-second.md`](./2025-05-18-second.md).
*   **10:38 AM** - Created new conversation thread for Phase 2 implementation: [`projets/neuchatech-foam/wiki/workflow/conversations/2025-05-18-phase2-implementation.md`](../conversations/2025-05-18-phase2-implementation.md).
*   **10:38 AM** - Provided instructions and commands for setting up the local development environment for the `neuchatech-foam` extension within `projets/neuchatech-foam`.
*   **11:11 AM** - User confirmed successful development environment setup.
*   **11:12 AM** - Attempted to read `graph.ts` at the expected path, but file was not found.
*   **11:12 AM** - Listed contents of `projets/neuchatech-foam/packages/foam-vscode/src/features/dataviz/` - directory not found.
*   **11:12 AM** - Listed contents of `projets/neuchatech-foam/packages/foam-vscode/src/` to explore file structure.
*   **11:12 AM** - Listed contents of `projets/neuchatech-foam/packages/foam-vscode/src/features/` to narrow down location.
*   **11:12 AM** - Listed contents of `projets/neuchatech-foam/packages/foam-vscode/src/features/panels/` and identified `dataviz.ts` as the likely target file.
*   **11:12 AM** - Read content of [`projets/neuchatech-foam/packages/foam-vscode/src/features/panels/dataviz.ts`](../../../../projets/neuchatech-foam/packages/foam-vscode/src/features/panels/dataviz.ts).
*   **11:12 AM** - Applied diff to add structural link generation logic and edge typing to `generateGraphData` in `dataviz.ts`. Encountered TypeScript errors related to `createRelative` and type mismatches.
*   **11:12 AM** - Searched for `vscode.Uri` usage in `projets/neuchatech-foam/packages/foam-vscode/src/` and identified `vscode.Uri.joinPath` as the correct method.
*   **11:12 AM** - Applied diff to replace `createRelative` with `vscode.Uri.joinPath`. Encountered TypeScript errors related to type mismatch between Foam's `URI` and `vscode.Uri`.
*   **11:13 AM** - Searched for `toVsCodeUri` in `projets/neuchatech-foam/packages/foam-vscode/src/utils/` and confirmed its existence in `vsc-utils.ts`.
*   **11:13 AM** - Applied diff to import `toVsCodeUri` in `dataviz.ts`. Resolved TypeScript errors.
*   **11:13 AM** - Noted remaining ESLint errors related to undefined rules.
*   **11:14 AM** - Listed contents of `projets/neuchatech-foam/static/dataviz/` - directory not found.
*   **11:14 AM** - Listed contents of `projets/neuchatech-foam/packages/foam-vscode/static/dataviz/` and identified `graph.js` and `graph.css`.
*   **11:14 AM** - Read content of [`projets/neuchatech-foam/packages/foam-vscode/static/dataviz/graph.js`](../../../../projets/neuchatech-foam/packages/foam-vscode/static/dataviz/graph.js).
*   **11:14 AM** - Applied diff to modify `getLinkColor` and `linkWidth` in `graph.js` to visually differentiate structural and reference links.
*   **11:16 AM** - User confirmed changes looked good and requested to continue implementation.
*   **11:16 AM** - Read content of [`projets/neuchatech-foam/packages/foam-vscode/static/dataviz/graph.js`](../../../../projets/neuchatech-foam/packages/foam-vscode/static/dataviz/graph.js) again to prepare for layout algorithm modifications.
*   **11:16 AM** - Applied diff to modify the force layout in `graph.js` to give structural edges higher spring force.
*   **11:17 AM** - Read content of [`projets/neuchatech-foam/packages/foam-vscode/static/dataviz/graph.js`](../../../../projets/neuchatech-foam/packages/foam-vscode/static/dataviz/graph.js) again to prepare for adaptive node title implementation.
*   **11:17 AM** - Applied diff to modify `nodeCanvasObject` in `graph.js` to implement adaptive node titles based on zoom level and node type.
*   **11:20 AM** - Read content of [`projets/neuchatech-foam/packages/foam-vscode/static/dataviz/graph.js`](../../../../projets/neuchatech-foam/packages/foam-vscode/static/dataviz/graph.js) again to prepare for hover tooltip implementation.
*   **11:20 AM** - Applied diff to modify `initDataviz` and `onNodeHover` in `graph.js` to implement hover tooltips.

## 4. Blockers & Challenges
*   Remaining ESLint errors related to undefined rules in `dataviz.ts`. These likely indicate an issue with the project's ESLint configuration rather than the code changes themselves.

---

## 5. Learnings & Observations
*   Agent workflow files are now part of the `neuchatech-foam` submodule's repository.
*   The file structure in the forked Foam repository is slightly different from the original planning documents.
*   Successfully implemented the core logic for structural link generation and edge typing in `dataviz.ts`.
*   Successfully modified `graph.js` to visually differentiate structural and reference links, adjust the layout force for structural edges, implement adaptive node titles, and add hover tooltips.

---

## 6. Next Steps
*   Update project chat to reflect the completed implementation step and the presence of ESLint errors.
*   Discuss the remaining ESLint errors and whether they need to be addressed immediately or can be handled later.
*   Review the completed implementation steps for Phase 2 and Phase 4 (partially completed) and determine the next logical step based on the project plan.
