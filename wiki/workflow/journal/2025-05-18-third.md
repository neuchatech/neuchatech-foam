# Daily Journal - 2025-05-18

**Session:** third

## 1. Session Goals
*   [x] Debug Neuchatech Foam graph not showing nodes.
*   [x] Implement structural links between folders in the graph.
*   [ ] Fix error when clicking synthetic folder nodes.
*   [ ] Address ESLint errors in `dataviz.ts`.

---

## 2. Project Understanding & Context
Continued debugging the blank graph issue in the Neuchatech Foam extension after building and installing it. The initial problem was "Resource not found" errors related to missing `README.md` and `index.md` files at the workspace root and in subdirectories. The goal is to make the graph robust to missing files and implement structural links based on folder hierarchy, as per the project's README.

Relevant discussions:
*   Initial report of blank graph and errors.
*   Debugging via Webview Developer Tools console.
*   Identification of "Resource not found" errors.
*   Decision to fix the code to handle missing files gracefully and implement structural links.

---

## 3. Progress & Activities
*   **[12:31 PM]** - Analyzed `projets/neuchatech-foam/packages/foam-vscode/src/features/panels/dataviz.ts` and identified that `foam.workspace.get()` calls for `README.md` and `index.md` were causing crashes when files were not found.
*   **[12:31 PM]** - Applied diff to add `try...catch` blocks around `foam.workspace.get()` calls for `README.md` and `index.md` within the folder processing loop in `generateGraphData` to prevent crashes on missing files.
*   **[12:38 PM]** - Received report of new "Resource not found" error for a file deep in the hierarchy (`.../docs/dev/README.md`), indicating the issue was more general than just root files.
*   **[12:38 PM]** - Applied diff to add a `try...catch` block around the processing of each note in the initial `foam.workspace.list().forEach` loop in `generateGraphData` to handle errors during property access for any note.
*   **[12:38 PM]** - Noticed new ESLint errors ("Definition for rule ... was not found"). Checked `.eslintrc.json` and `packages/foam-vscode/package.json` and confirmed dependencies are listed. Concluded likely environment/editor issue and recommended clean `yarn install`.
*   **[12:50 PM]** - User confirmed clean install resolved ESLint issues (implicitly, by not mentioning them in the next message) but reported that inter-folder structural links were not present and clicking synthetic folder nodes caused a "Resource not found" error.
*   **[12:50 PM]** - Started implementing inter-folder structural links. Added a `getOrCreateFolderNode` helper function to standardize getting/creating nodes for folders (either from README/index or synthetic).
*   **[12:50 PM]** - Attempted to refactor `generateGraphData` to use `getOrCreateFolderNode` and add parent-child folder links. `apply_diff` failed due to file changes.
*   **[12:50 PM]** - Re-read `dataviz.ts` to get the latest content.
*   **[12:50 PM]** - Successfully applied the refactoring to `generateGraphData` to use `getOrCreateFolderNode`, iterate over unique folders, link child notes, and add structural links between parent and child folder nodes. Also updated how the workspace root URI is obtained using `vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders`.

---

## 4. Blockers & Challenges
*   The `apply_diff` tool can be sensitive to file changes between reads, requiring re-reading the file to get accurate line numbers for subsequent diffs.
*   The core Foam API (`foam.workspace.get`) throws errors on missing resources, which needed to be explicitly handled in the graph generation logic.
*   Clicking on synthetic folder nodes in the graph still causes a "Resource not found" error, as the Webview's click handler attempts to open them as files.

---

## 5. Learnings & Observations
*   Robust error handling is crucial when interacting with external APIs or potentially inconsistent data sources like the workspace file list.
*   Monorepo dependency management and editor integration (like ESLint) can sometimes be tricky, requiring clean installs to resolve.
*   The graph generation logic needs to distinguish between different node types (notes, placeholders, synthetic folders) and handle interactions (like clicks) appropriately for each.

---

## 6. Next Steps
*   Instruct the user to rebuild and reinstall the extension to test the implemented structural links.
*   Address the error that occurs when clicking on synthetic folder nodes by modifying the Webview's click handler to not attempt to open folder URIs as files.
*   Confirm that the ESLint errors are resolved after the clean install.
